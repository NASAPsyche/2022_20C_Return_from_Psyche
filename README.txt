Build Instructions

Unity Version: 2020.3.20f1

Directions:
Launch game in Unity. The game has not been tested with other versions of Unity so I would recommend using the version above.
Click File in the top left corner of the program, then Build Settings.
Select WebGL as the platform.
Click Build. This will open a File Explorer window.
Select the “Builds” folder.
Once the game finishes building, drag all files outside of the “Builds” folder into the root directory.
If asked to replace files, select yes.
When publishing, select the root folder as the source for the build.
